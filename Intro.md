Course Syllabus for "CS401: Operating Systems"
----------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to modern operating systems.  We will
focus on UNIX-based operating systems, though we will also learn about
alternative operating systems, including Windows.  The course will begin
with an overview of the structure of modern operating systems.  Over the
course of the subsequent units, we will discuss the history of modern
computers, analyze in detail each of the major components of an
operating system (from processes to threads), and explore more advanced
topics in the field, including memory management and file input/output. 
The class will conclude with a discussion of various system-related
security issues.

### Course Information

Welcome to CS401!  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements. 

**Course Designer: **John Russo

**Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   YouTube: University California, Berkeley: Professor John
    Kubiatowicz’s [OS Course Video
    Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73QtUu42BAs&list=PL3A5075EC94726781&index=2)
-   IIT Kharagpur NPTEL [Online](http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units. 

You will also need to complete a Final Exam.  Please note that you will
only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.  In order to “pass”
the course, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher on the Final
Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course will take approximately **119.75
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful totake a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 takes 19 hours to complete.  Perhaps you
could sit down with your calendar and plan to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 3.5 hours) on Monday and Tuesday evenings; subunit 1.2 (a total
of 2.5 hours) on Wednesday evening; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions: **It may be helpful to take notes for each of the
resources presented in this course, organizing your notes based on the
structure of the units, and subunits.  These notes will be useful as you
study for your Final Exam.
