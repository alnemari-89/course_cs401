**Unit 1: Introduction to Operating Systems** <span id="1"></span> 
**We will begin* *this course with a high level introduction to
Operating Systems (OS).  The Operating* *System acts as a platform of
information exchange between your computer’s hardware and the
applications running on it.  Most people are familiar with the Windows
Operating System family (2000, XP, Vista, etc.) or Apple’s suite of
Operating Systems (Leopard, Snow Leopard, etc.), but for the purposes of
this course, we will focus on UNIX:  the open-source OS deployed all
over the world in both personal and commercial systems. * *First, we
will start with a discussion on some of the earliest Operating Systems,
including those which are considered precursors to the Operating Systems
that we are familiar with today.  Then, we will review the general OS
structure and give a basic functional overview.  We will conclude this
module with a discussion of the modern Operating Systems and devices
that we are familiar with.  **
