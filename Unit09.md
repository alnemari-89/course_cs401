**Unit 9: Networking** <span id="9"></span> 
*Computer networking has become an increasingly important field.  When
we discuss networking, we are not just referring to connecting computers
together in one location but also about broader connections through the
Internet.  This unit will provide the student with an introduction to
networking and serve as a primer for CS402*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 11 hours to complete.
